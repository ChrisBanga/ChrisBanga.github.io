      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Rumour has it that I'm a human-being.</p>
      <p>Driven, enthusiastic and passionate could be used to define the person
      that I am.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I'm an East African citizen, born in Burundi, raised in Rwanda and
      currently living in Kenya (for the past 9 years!)</p>
      <p>My days are split between school at University of Nairobi where I'm
      completing my Bsc.Biochemistry and work at a Tech startup based in Kigali
      where I'm in charge of project coordination.</p>

                <p> To quote Marcus Tullius Cicero, <em>"A room without a book is like a
                body without a soul"</em>.</p>
                <p>I love reading. I am not particularly picky but I have a weakness
                for current affairs and non-fiction. </p>
                <p>But I had one book to recommend to anyone,it would be The
                Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.</p>
                <p>In case you want to know more about the book,
