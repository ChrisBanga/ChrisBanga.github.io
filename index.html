      <h2> About me </h2>
      <p> Rumour has it that I'm a human-being. </p>
      <p> Driven, enthusiastic and passionate could be used to define the person
      that I am. </p>


      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>I refer to myself as an East African as citizen of both Rwanda and
      Burundi and....(wait fo it)I've lived in Kenya for close a decade. </p>
      <p> Currently, I'm completing my Bsc.Biochemistry at the University of
      Nairobi with the hope of graduating at the end of year.</p>
      <p> Other than that, I work remotely for a startup company based in Rwanda
      where I serve as a project coordinator. </p>
      <p> My coding journey started a few weeks ago, born of curiosity and
      and the desire to challenge myself </p>
